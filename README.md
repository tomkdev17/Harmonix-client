Harmonix is a MERN application that uses the Parcel bundler as a dev dependency. The songs and user data received by this client-side application is served by an API created specifically for this application, which is hosted on Heroku (Link: 'https://harmonix-daebd0a88259.herokuapp.com/') . The documentation for the API can be found at the above link. 

The actions that you should be able to perform are : Creating/deleting an account, logging in/out, searching specific songs, viewing song information, adding/removing songs from your favorites list, and viewing your profile data (including your list of favorite songs) . 

This is my first interaction with the MERN stack and it's been a whirlwind of learning and personal growth. I'm so excited to share this application with the world, so if you're reading this, thank you for checking out my work!
